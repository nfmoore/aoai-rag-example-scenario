# Example Scenarios: Generative AI Applications with Azure OpenAI


## :books: Overview

This repository demonstrates small-scale proof-of-concept deployments of Generative AI applications with Azure OpenAI. The repository showcases the capabilities of Azure OpenAI and provides a foundation for enterprises seeking to implement Generative AI applications with Azure OpenAI.

## :computer: Getting Started

This repository will highlight different areas of interest when implementing Generative AI applications with Azure OpenAI. Each example scenario demonstrates a small-scale proof-of-concept that can be used as a foundation for enterprises seeking to implement Generative AI applications with Azure OpenAI.

More information on the example scenarios is outlined in the [Getting Started](.github/docs/getting-started.md) section of this repository.

### Setup

Detailed instructions for deploying these proofs-of-concept are outlined in the [Step-by-Step Setup](.github/docs/step-by-step-setup.md) section of this repository. The example scenarios will illustrate concepts such as:

- Building a search index using Azure AI Search that can be used to retrieve relevant information.
- Implementing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern.
- Developing a lightweight web interface for a chatbot using Streamlit.
- Deploying the Generative AI application using Streamlit.
- Deploy the application using Azure Container Apps.

### Example Scenarios

This proof-of-concept will cover the following example scenarios:

| Example Scenario | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Pull-Based Data Ingestion with Azure AI Search & Custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Implementation | A small-scale proof-of-concept deployment of a chatbot leveraging the power of Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search, built and deployed using Streamlit. This approach explores implementing a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern and implementing a stand-alone knowledge retrieval solution populated with push-based indexing in Azure AI Search. |
